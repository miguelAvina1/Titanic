### Overview ###

This project analyzes the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from
the Kaggle challenge named "Titanic". The purpose of the activity is to learn
how to preprocess datasets and handle missing data.

The project follows the steps described in the [Instructions](https://github.com/miguelAvina1/Titanic/blob/master/Instructions/Tarea_Titanic.pdf)
 provided. Titanic.R is the resulting script, which in some parts is heavily
 based on example_Titanic.R, a reference material provided by the professor of the course.
